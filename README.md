## Quick Start for LLM Models

For LLM models working with this data lake:

1. **FIRST**: Read [Configuration Reference](./docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md) to understand all business-specific values

1. **CRITICAL**: Read [Claude Execution Guidelines](./docs/core-reference/claude-execution-guidelines.md) to understand when to execute vs provide code

1. **ESSENTIAL**: Review [Reporting Brand Standards](./docs/advanced-topics/reporting-brand-standards.md) for professional HTML artifact requirements

1. **MANDATORY**: Use [HTML Report Template](./docs/advanced-topics/html-report-template.md) for all GRAX reports with complete branding and visualizations

1. **NEW**: Utilize [Data Quality Framework](./docs/data-quality/README.md) for comprehensive data quality assessment, scoring, and remediation strategies

1. **Understand**: Review [Database Schema Guide](./docs/core-reference/database-schema-guide.md) for available data structures

1. **Reference**: Use [Athena SQL Syntax Guide](./docs/query-guidance/athena-sql-syntax-guide.md) for proper query formation

1. **Apply**: Use [Query Templates](./docs/query-guidance/query-templates.md) for common analysis patterns

1. **Follow**: Apply [Query Best Practices](./docs/query-guidance/query-best-practices.md) to avoid common errors

1. **Adapt**: Use [Customer Fallback Instructions](./docs/troubleshooting/customer-fallback-instructions.md) when queries return zero results

## Key Principles

- **Configuration First**: Always reference the Configuration Reference for business-specific values
- **Execute First**: When customers ask for reports/analysis, execute queries and provide insights
- **Professional Presentation**: ALL GRAX reports must be delivered as polished HTML artifacts following brand standards using the mandatory HTML template
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Include charts, graphs, and interactive elements in all reports unless explicitly requested otherwise
- **Data Quality Focus**: Leverage the comprehensive data quality framework for analysis, scoring, and remediation across all Salesforce objects
- **Graceful Adaptation**: Use fallback strategies when customer configurations differ from defaults
- All queries must filter deleted records using `grax__deleted IS NULL`
- Use latest records pattern for current state analysis
- Follow proper field naming conventions with type suffixes
- Apply sequential stage logic for sales funnel analysis
- Prioritize performance optimization and error prevention

## Database Environment

- **Engine**: Amazon Athena
- **Workgroup**: lakehouse
- **Catalog**: lakehouse
- **Database**: lakehouse
- **Data Source**: Salesforce historical data with complete change tracking

## Field Naming Conventions

- `_f` suffix: Numeric fields for calculations
- `_ts` suffix: Timestamp fields for date operations
- `_d` suffix: Date-only fields
- `_b` suffix: Boolean fields
- `_i` suffix: Integer fields

## Customization for Different Organizations

The knowledge base is built with GRAX's default Salesforce configuration but can be easily adapted:

1. **Review** the [Configuration Reference](./docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md) for all default values
1. **Modify** configuration values to match your organization's Salesforce setup
1. **Test** queries with your specific field values and stage names
1. **Use** the [Customer Fallback Instructions](./docs/troubleshooting/customer-fallback-instructions.md) for automatic adaptation

## Documentation Standards Guide

### For Contributors and LLM Models

**Zero-Tolerance Compliance**: All documentation must pass complete markdown linting validation as defined in `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`.

**Configuration Integration**: Never hardcode business values in documentation or queries. All business-specific values must reference the centralized [Configuration Reference](./docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md).

**Professional Standards**: All customer-facing reports and analyses must follow [Reporting Brand Standards](./docs/advanced-topics/reporting-brand-standards.md) and use the [HTML Report Template](./docs/advanced-topics/html-report-template.md).

**Data Quality Standards**: Leverage the [Data Quality Framework](./docs/data-quality/README.md) for systematic data quality assessment and improvement across all Salesforce objects.

### Directory Structure Guidelines

**Logical Organization**:

- **getting-started/**: New user onboarding and basic concepts
- **core-reference/**: Essential configuration, database schema, and execution guidelines
- **query-guidance/**: SQL patterns, best practices, and syntax guides
- **analysis-patterns/**: Business intelligence templates and specialized analysis
- **data-quality/**: Comprehensive framework for data quality analysis, scoring, and remediation
- **advanced-topics/**: Professional reporting standards and enterprise customization
- **troubleshooting/**: Error handling, debugging, and fallback procedures

**Cross-Reference Requirements**: All documents must include proper links to related documentation using relative paths that respect the directory structure.

**Scalability Design**: The structure supports unlimited expansion within each directory while maintaining logical organization and discoverability.

**Data Quality Integration**: All new object implementations must include corresponding data quality framework components (analysis, scoring, remediation) following the standardized patterns established in the lead data quality implementation.

## Contributing

This knowledge base is designed for programmatic consumption by LLM models. All documentation follows strict markdown linting rules and is optimized for clarity and precision in automated query generation.

**Contribution Workflow**:

1. **Follow Standards**: Ensure all contributions meet documentation standards and linting requirements
1. **Update Configuration**: Add any new business values to the centralized Configuration Reference
1. **Test Integration**: Validate that new documentation integrates properly with existing patterns
1. **Maintain Links**: Ensure all cross-references use correct relative paths
1. **Brand Compliance**: Verify any customer-facing content meets professional presentation standards
1. **Data Quality Integration**: Include data quality framework components for any new object implementations
