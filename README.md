- **[Query Best Practices](./docs/query-best-practices.md)** - Performance optimization and error prevention guidelines
- **[Athena SQL Syntax Guide](./docs/athena-sql-syntax-guide.md)** - Athena-specific SQL patterns and corrections

### LLM Execution Guidance

- **[Claude Execution Guidelines](./docs/claude-execution-guidelines.md)** - **CRITICAL**: When to execute queries vs provide code templates

### Query Templates and Patterns

- **[Query Templates](./docs/query-templates.md)** - Reusable query patterns for common analysis tasks
- **[Sales Process Analysis](./docs/sales-process-analysis.md)** - Lead qualification and opportunity progression tracking

## Quick Start

For LLM models working with this data lake:

1. **FIRST**: Read [Claude Execution Guidelines](./docs/claude-execution-guidelines.md) to understand when to execute vs provide code

1. **Start with** the [Database Schema Guide](./docs/database-schema-guide.md) to understand available data structures

1. **Reference** the [Athena SQL Syntax Guide](./docs/athena-sql-syntax-guide.md) for proper query formation

1. **Use** the [Query Templates](./docs/query-templates.md) for common analysis patterns

1. **Follow** the [Query Best Practices](./docs/query-best-practices.md) to avoid common errors

## Key Principles

- **Execute First**: When customers ask for reports/analysis, execute queries and provide insights
- All queries must filter deleted records using `grax__deleted IS NULL`
- Use latest records pattern for current state analysis
- Follow proper field naming conventions with type suffixes
- Apply sequential stage logic for sales funnel analysis
- Prioritize performance optimization and error prevention

## Database Environment

- **Engine**: Amazon Athena
- **Workgroup**: lakehouse
- **Catalog**: lakehouse
- **Database**: lakehouse
- **Data Source**: Salesforce historical data with complete change tracking

## Field Naming Conventions

- `_f` suffix: Numeric fields for calculations
- `_ts` suffix: Timestamp fields for date operations
- `_d` suffix: Date-only fields
- `_b` suffix: Boolean fields
- `_i` suffix: Integer fields

## Contributing

This knowledge base is designed for programmatic consumption by LLM models. All documentation follows strict markdown linting rules and is optimized for clarity and precision in automated query generation.
