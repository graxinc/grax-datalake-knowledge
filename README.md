## Overview

This repository contains structured documentation that enables large language models to effectively understand, navigate, and query Salesforce data stored in a data lake using Amazon Athena. The knowledge base is optimized for LLM consumption and provides comprehensive coverage of data structures, query patterns, and best practices.

## Documentation Structure

- **[Athena SQL Syntax Guide](./docs/athena-sql-syntax-guide.md)** - Athena-specific SQL patterns and corrections

### LLM Execution Guidance

- **[Claude Execution Guidelines](./docs/claude-execution-guidelines.md)** - **CRITICAL**: When to execute queries vs provide code templates

### Reporting and Brand Standards

- **[Reporting and Brand Standards](./docs/reporting-brand-standards.md)** - **ESSENTIAL**: Professional branding and HTML artifact requirements for all GRAX reports
- **[HTML Report Template](./docs/html-report-template.md)** - **MANDATORY**: Complete HTML template with CSS styling for all GRAX reports

### Multi-Customer Support

- **[Customer Fallback Instructions](./docs/customer-fallback-instructions.md)** - Adapting queries for different Salesforce implementations

- **[Business Intelligence Patterns](./docs/business-intelligence-patterns.md)** - Advanced analytics and reporting templates

## Quick Start

For LLM models working with this data lake:

1. **FIRST**: Read [Configuration Reference](./docs/configuration-reference.md) to understand all business-specific values

1. **CRITICAL**: Read [Claude Execution Guidelines](./docs/claude-execution-guidelines.md) to understand when to execute vs provide code

1. **ESSENTIAL**: Review [Reporting and Brand Standards](./docs/reporting-brand-standards.md) for professional HTML artifact requirements

1. **MANDATORY**: Use [HTML Report Template](./docs/html-report-template.md) for all GRAX reports with complete branding and visualizations

1. **Understand**: Review [Database Schema Guide](./docs/database-schema-guide.md) for available data structures

1. **Reference**: Use [Athena SQL Syntax Guide](./docs/athena-sql-syntax-guide.md) for proper query formation

1. **Apply**: Use [Query Templates](./docs/query-templates.md) for common analysis patterns

1. **Follow**: Apply [Query Best Practices](./docs/query-best-practices.md) to avoid common errors

1. **Adapt**: Use [Customer Fallback Instructions](./docs/customer-fallback-instructions.md) when queries return zero results

## Key Principles

- **Configuration First**: Always reference the Configuration Reference for business-specific values
- **Execute First**: When customers ask for reports/analysis, execute queries and provide insights
- **Professional Presentation**: ALL GRAX reports must be delivered as polished HTML artifacts following brand standards using the mandatory HTML template
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Include charts, graphs, and interactive elements in all reports unless explicitly requested otherwise
- **Graceful Adaptation**: Use fallback strategies when customer configurations differ from defaults
- All queries must filter deleted records using `grax__deleted IS NULL`
- Use latest records pattern for current state analysis
- Follow proper field naming conventions with type suffixes
- Apply sequential stage logic for sales funnel analysis
- Prioritize performance optimization and error prevention

## Database Environment

- **Engine**: Amazon Athena
- **Workgroup**: lakehouse
- **Catalog**: lakehouse
- **Database**: lakehouse
- **Data Source**: Salesforce historical data with complete change tracking

## Field Naming Conventions

- `_f` suffix: Numeric fields for calculations
- `_ts` suffix: Timestamp fields for date operations
- `_d` suffix: Date-only fields
- `_b` suffix: Boolean fields
- `_i` suffix: Integer fields

## Customization for Different Organizations

The knowledge base is built with GRAX's default Salesforce configuration but can be easily adapted:

1. **Review** the [Configuration Reference](./docs/configuration-reference.md) for all default values
1. **Modify** configuration values to match your organization's Salesforce setup
1. **Test** queries with your specific field values and stage names
1. **Use** the [Customer Fallback Instructions](./docs/customer-fallback-instructions.md) for automatic adaptation

## Contributing

This knowledge base is designed for programmatic consumption by LLM models. All documentation follows strict markdown linting rules and is optimized for clarity and precision in automated query generation.
