# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Grax Data Lake Knowledge system is designed to provide scalable data management and knowledge extraction capabilities.

### Core Components

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Handles data import from various sources
- **Processing Engine**: Processes and transforms raw data
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extracts insights and knowledge from processed data
- **Storage Layer**: Manages data persistence and retrieval
- **API Layer**: Provides programmatic access to system functionality

### Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Data enters the system through various connectors
2. **Validation**: Data is validated for quality and compliance
3. **Processing**: Raw data is transformed and enriched
4. **Storage**: Processed data is stored in the data lake
5. **Indexing**: Data is indexed for efficient retrieval
6. **Access**: Users and applications access data through APIs

## Technology Stack

- **Storage**: Object storage with metadata catalogs
- **Processing**: Distributed computing frameworks
- **API**: RESTful services with authentication
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Auto-scaling based on workload
- Data partitioning strategies
- Caching mechanisms
