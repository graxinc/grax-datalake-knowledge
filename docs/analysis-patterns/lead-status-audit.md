# Lead Status Audit

## Overview

This guide provides a framework for identifying leads that should be classified as "Existing Customer" but are currently marked as active prospects. This analysis prevents unnecessary sales outreach to existing customers and ensures accurate lead qualification metrics.

**Configuration Dependencies**: All lead status values, account types, and classification logic in this document use standardized values from [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md). Organizations with different Salesforce configurations should update that document to match their specific values.

## Business Problem

**Issue**: Active leads may actually be from existing customer organizations, leading to:

- Wasted sales resources on existing customers
- Potential customer confusion from duplicate outreach  
- Inaccurate funnel metrics and conversion rates
- Missed opportunities for account expansion vs new acquisition

**Goal**: Identify leads where the email domain matches existing customer accounts to enable proper lead status correction.

## Customer Account Definition

An account is considered an "Existing Customer" based on **Account Type** field values defined in [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md):

**Customer Types** (from [Account Classification Configuration](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md#account-classification-configuration)):

- `Type = 'Customer'` - Primary customer accounts
- `Type = 'Customer - Subsidiary'` - Customer subsidiary accounts

**Exclusions**:

- Accounts with `Type = 'Prospect'` are **NEVER** considered existing customers
- Annual revenue is **NOT** used for customer identification (following [Customer Identification Logic](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md#customer-identification-logic))

## Lead Classification Logic

A lead should be classified as "Existing Customer" if:

1. Lead Status â‰  `'Existing Customer'` (current misclassification)

1. Lead is currently active (MCL or MQL status using values from [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md))

1. Lead email domain matches an existing customer account domain

1. Matching account has `Type = 'Customer'` OR `Type = 'Customer - Subsidiary'`

1. Matching account does NOT have `Type = 'Prospect'`

## Summary Analysis

### Misclassified Leads by Customer Type

```sql
-- Summarize misclassified leads using the core analysis as a CTE
WITH misclassified_leads AS (
    -- [Insert complete core analysis query above]
)
SELECT 
    customer_classification,
    COUNT(*) as lead_count,
    -- Using lead status values from docs/configuration-reference.md
    COUNT(CASE WHEN current_lead_status = 'Open' THEN 1 END) as mcl_leads,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN current_lead_status = 'Working' THEN 1 END) as mql_leads,
    AVG(days_since_lead_created) as avg_days_old,
    -- Validation check
    COUNT(CASE WHEN match_validation LIKE '%ERROR%' THEN 1 END) as validation_errors

GROUP BY customer_classification
ORDER BY lead_count DESC
```

## Business Impact Analysis

### Revenue Protection

- Prevents sales outreach conflicts with existing customer success teams
- Ensures prospect accounts remain in active sales pipeline
- Eliminates false positive customer classifications
- Reduces risk of customer confusion from properly classified customers

### Process Efficiency

- Eliminates wasted sales development resources on actual existing customers
- Preserves sales opportunities with ALL prospect accounts
- Improves lead qualification accuracy using Account Type governance from [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md)
- Enables better territory and quota planning

### Data Governance

- Establishes Account Type as single source of truth for customer classification (per [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md))
- Simplifies customer identification process
- Removes dependency on financial metrics for customer status
- Creates clear, auditable classification rules

## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Execute Core Analysis**: Run the main query to identify all misclassified leads

1. **Validate Results**: Use validation queries to confirm logic correctness

1. **Update Lead Status**: Change identified leads from active status to `'Existing Customer'` (using status value from [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md))

1. **Document Process**: Record classification rules and validation steps

### Ongoing Monitoring

1. **Weekly Audits**: Run analysis weekly to catch new misclassifications

1. **Process Integration**: Build checks into lead import and qualification workflows

1. **Training Updates**: Educate sales teams on proper customer identification using values from [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md)

1. **Metric Adjustment**: Update funnel reports to reflect corrected classifications

## Configuration Adaptation

For organizations with different Salesforce implementations, update the [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md) document with your specific values:

### Lead Status Audit Configuration Updates

1. **Lead Status Values**: Update `'Open'`, `'Working'`, `'Existing Customer'` to match your lead qualification stages
1. **Account Types**: Modify `'Customer'`, `'Customer - Subsidiary'`, `'Prospect'` with your account classification values
1. **Active Lead Criteria**: Adjust which status values indicate active leads requiring audit
1. **Exclusion Logic**: Update which account types should be excluded from customer matching

### Validation Process

1. **Update Configuration**: Modify values in [Configuration Reference](/docs/core-reference/configuration-reference.md)
1. **Test Analysis**: Execute the core analysis query with your configuration
1. **Validate Logic**: Ensure classification results make sense for your business context
1. **Document Changes**: Record customizations for audit trail purposes

This comprehensive audit framework ensures accurate lead classification that respects the distinction between confirmed customers and active prospects while maintaining data integrity and supporting effective sales operations across different Salesforce implementations.
