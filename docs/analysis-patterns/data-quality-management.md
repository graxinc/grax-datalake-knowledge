# Data Quality Management

## Overview

Data quality directly impacts sales funnel accuracy, customer segmentation precision, and business intelligence reliability. This document provides global analysis instructions and strategic guidance that complements the comprehensive [Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/README.md).

**IMPORTANT**: For detailed data quality analysis, scoring, and remediation implementations, use the dedicated [Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/README.md). This document focuses on strategic guidance and cross-object considerations that apply universally across the framework.

## Strategic Data Quality Approach

### Framework Integration Strategy

**Comprehensive Coverage**: The [Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/README.md) provides systematic tools for analyzing, scoring, and remediating data quality issues across all Salesforce objects with standardized methodologies.

**Object-Specific Implementation**: Each Salesforce object has dedicated analysis, scoring, and remediation documentation within the framework:

- **Lead Data Quality**: [Analysis](../data-quality/lead/analysis.md) | [Scoring](../data-quality/lead/scoring.md) | [Remediation](../data-quality/lead/remediation.md)
- **Future Objects**: Opportunity, Account, Contact, and Case implementations follow identical patterns for consistency and scalability

**Configuration Integration**: All data quality assessments reference standardized values from [Configuration Reference](../core-reference/configuration-reference.md) to ensure adaptability across different Salesforce implementations.

## Data Quality Dimensions Framework

### 1. Completeness
**Definition**: Presence of critical fields required for business processes

**Strategic Impact**:
- Lead qualification accuracy and conversion tracking
- Customer segmentation capability and territory assignment  
- Contact information completeness for effective outreach campaigns
- Account relationship mapping and corporate family analysis

### 2. Accuracy  
**Definition**: Correctness and validity of data values

**Common Accuracy Issues**:
- Email format violations and deliverability problems
- Unrealistic firmographic data (revenue, employee counts)
- Outdated or incorrect company information
- Invalid geographic and contact information

### 3. Consistency
**Definition**: Uniformity of data across related records and objects

**Cross-Object Consistency Examples**:
- Lead company names matching account names after conversion
- Consistent segmentation classifications between leads and accounts
- Opportunity amounts aligning with account potential revenue
- Contact information consistency between leads and contacts

### 4. Validity
**Definition**: Data conforming to defined formats and business rules

**Validation Categories**:
- Format compliance (email patterns, phone structures)
- Business rule adherence (status progressions, stage sequences)  
- Value range validation (realistic financial and sizing data)
- Temporal integrity (dates, timestamps, progression logic)

### 5. Uniqueness
**Definition**: Absence of inappropriate duplicate records

**Duplicate Management Strategy**:
- Email-based lead deduplication (highest priority)
- Company name standardization across objects
- Contact consolidation and relationship mapping
- Account hierarchy and corporate family management

## Cross-Object Data Quality Strategy

### Multi-Object Relationship Integrity

**Lead-to-Opportunity Consistency**:
- Conversion relationship validation using [Lead Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/lead/)
- Account linking accuracy and corporate family relationships
- Stage progression logic and timeline consistency

**Account-Opportunity Alignment**:
- Account segmentation consistency with opportunity sizing
- Territory alignment and ownership management
- Corporate hierarchy and subsidiary relationship integrity

**Contact-Lead Integration**:
- Email uniqueness across lead and contact objects
- Role and title consistency for same individuals
- Communication preference and engagement history alignment

### Data Quality Scoring Integration

**Object-Level Scoring**: Each object maintains independent quality scores using standardized 0-100 methodologies from the [Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/README.md).

**Cross-Object Impact Assessment**: 
- Conversion quality affects both lead and opportunity scores
- Account data quality impacts related opportunity and contact assessments
- Contact consistency influences lead qualification accuracy

**Aggregate Quality Metrics**:
- Overall CRM health score combining all object quality assessments
- Process-specific quality scores (lead generation, opportunity management, customer success)
- Trend analysis across objects to identify systemic quality issues

## Implementation Priorities by Business Impact

- Automated remediation workflows for common quality issues
- Integration with business processes for quality enforcement

## Configuration Management for Data Quality

### Universal Configuration Requirements

**Business Rule Validation**: All data quality assessments must reference centralized [Configuration Reference](../core-reference/configuration-reference.md) values to ensure:
- Consistent validation across all objects and analysis types
- Easy adaptation for different Salesforce implementations
- Maintainable quality standards and threshold management

**Quality Standard Definitions**:
- Acceptable completion rates for critical fields by object type
- Validation pattern requirements for format compliance
- Business logic rules for cross-object consistency checking
- Threshold values for realistic data ranges and limits

### Testing and Validation Process

**Configuration Testing**:
1. **Update Standards**: Modify quality thresholds in [Configuration Reference](../core-reference/configuration-reference.md)
1. **Execute Analysis**: Run object-specific quality assessments from [Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/README.md)
1. **Validate Results**: Ensure quality scores align with business expectations
1. **Document Standards**: Record organization-specific quality requirements and benchmarks

This strategic data quality management approach ensures comprehensive coverage while avoiding duplication with the detailed [Data Quality Framework](../data-quality/README.md) implementation. Focus on cross-object considerations and strategic guidance while leveraging the framework for specific analysis, scoring, and remediation activities.
