# Reporting and Brand Standards

## Project Overview

This document establishes comprehensive reporting and brand standards for all GRAX data lake analytics outputs. These standards ensure consistent visual identity, messaging alignment, and professional presentation across all customer-facing reports, dashboards, and analysis deliverables.

**Configuration Dependencies**: All business-specific values referenced in examples use standardized configuration from [Configuration Reference](./configuration-reference.md). Organizations should update that document to match their specific branding requirements rather than modifying individual templates.
