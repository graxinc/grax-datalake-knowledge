# Troubleshooting

This directory contains comprehensive error handling, debugging guidance, and fallback procedures for resolving issues with GRAX Data Lake analytics.

## Error Resolution Framework

**Systematic Approach**: When issues arise with GRAX Data Lake queries or analysis, follow a structured troubleshooting methodology that identifies root causes and provides reliable solutions.

**Customer Success Focus**: All troubleshooting procedures prioritize maintaining customer productivity while resolving issues quickly and permanently.

## Documents in This Section

### Core Troubleshooting

- **[Customer Fallback Instructions](customer-fallback-instructions.md)** - Adapting queries for different Salesforce implementations when standard patterns fail

### Error Categories

**Query Execution Errors**:
- Column resolution issues
- Syntax validation failures  
- Performance timeouts
- Data type conflicts

**Configuration Mismatches**:
- Picklist value differences
- Custom field variations
- Business process variations
- Data model customizations

**Data Quality Issues**:
- Missing expected records
- Unexpected result patterns
- Historical data inconsistencies
- Integration synchronization problems

## Troubleshooting Methodology

### Phase 1: Issue Identification

**Rapid Diagnosis**:

1. **Error Message Analysis**: Extract specific error details and categorize the issue type
1. **Context Assessment**: Understand what the user was trying to accomplish
1. **Environment Check**: Verify database connection, permissions, and basic functionality
1. **Configuration Review**: Compare expected vs. actual Salesforce configuration values

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis

**Systematic Investigation**:

1. **Data Validation**: Verify expected data exists and matches anticipated patterns
1. **Query Structure**: Validate SQL syntax and logic against Athena requirements
1. **Configuration Mapping**: Compare customer Salesforce setup to standardized assumptions
1. **Historical Context**: Check if this is a new issue or recurring pattern

### Phase 3: Solution Implementation

**Multi-Level Resolution**:

1. **Immediate Fix**: Provide working solution for the specific customer request
1. **Configuration Update**: Modify [Configuration Reference](../core-reference/configuration-reference.md) if needed
1. **Documentation Enhancement**: Improve guidance to prevent similar issues
1. **Process Improvement**: Update procedures based on lessons learned

## Common Issue Patterns

### Configuration-Related Issues

**Symptom**: Queries return zero results or unexpected data patterns

**Root Cause**: Customer Salesforce implementation uses different:
- Lead status values
- Opportunity stage names  
- Account classification types
- Custom field configurations

**Resolution Approach**: Use [Customer Fallback Instructions](customer-fallback-instructions.md) to adapt queries for customer-specific configuration.

### Query Performance Issues

**Symptom**: Queries timeout or consume excessive resources

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing date boundaries
- Inefficient filtering patterns
- Large dataset scans without optimization
- Missing latest records patterns

**Resolution Approach**: Apply [Query Best Practices](../query-guidance/query-best-practices.md) optimization techniques.

### Data Quality Concerns

**Symptom**: Analysis results that don't match business expectations

**Root Cause**:
- Data synchronization delays
- Soft-deleted record inclusion
- Historical data version conflicts
- Business process changes not reflected in analysis

**Resolution Approach**: Use [Data Quality Management](../analysis-patterns/data-quality-management.md) validation patterns.

## Error Prevention Strategies

### Proactive Configuration Management

**Best Practices**:

1. **Configuration Documentation**: Maintain complete [Configuration Reference](../core-reference/configuration-reference.md) for each customer
1. **Validation Testing**: Test all query templates after configuration changes
1. **Change Management**: Document and communicate configuration updates
1. **Regular Audits**: Verify configuration accuracy periodically

### Defensive Query Design

**Protective Patterns**:

1. **Null Handling**: Always account for missing or null values
1. **Data Validation**: Include checks for expected data patterns
1. **Error Boundaries**: Use COALESCE and CASE statements for robust logic
1. **Performance Limits**: Include reasonable date bounds and row limits

### Customer Communication

**Transparent Process**:

1. **Issue Acknowledgment**: Promptly confirm receipt and understanding of issues
1. **Progress Updates**: Provide regular status updates during resolution
1. **Solution Explanation**: Clearly explain what caused the issue and how it was resolved
1. **Prevention Guidance**: Share steps to avoid similar issues in the future

## Escalation Procedures

### Internal Escalation

**When to Escalate**:
- Complex data model issues requiring deep Salesforce expertise
- Performance problems requiring infrastructure changes
- Customer configuration variations not covered by existing patterns
- Repeated issues indicating systemic problems

**Escalation Process**:
1. Document all attempted solutions and their results
1. Provide complete error reproduction steps
1. Include customer environment details and configuration specifics
1. Suggest potential areas for permanent resolution

### Customer Escalation

**When to Involve Customer**:
- Issues requiring customer Salesforce administrator input
- Configuration changes needed in customer's Salesforce org
- Business process clarifications needed for accurate analysis
- Custom field or workflow documentation required

**Customer Communication**:
1. Explain the technical issue in business terms
1. Clearly specify what information or access is needed
1. Provide timeline expectations for resolution
1. Offer alternative approaches while waiting for customer input

## Success Metrics

### Resolution Effectiveness

**Tracking Criteria**:
- **Time to Resolution**: Average time from issue report to working solution
- **First Contact Resolution**: Percentage of issues resolved without escalation
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Feedback on troubleshooting experience and solution quality
- **Prevention Success**: Reduction in similar issues after documentation improvements

### Process Improvement

**Continuous Enhancement**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common issue types for proactive prevention
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhance guidance based on real customer issues
- **Tool Development**: Create utilities to automate common troubleshooting steps
- **Training Enhancement**: Improve team capabilities based on troubleshooting experiences

## Integration with Core Documentation

Troubleshooting procedures integrate with:

- **[Database Schema Guide](../core-reference/database-schema-guide.md)** - Field validation and data structure verification
- **[Configuration Reference](../core-reference/configuration-reference.md)** - Business value validation and customization
- **[Query Best Practices](../query-guidance/query-best-practices.md)** - Performance optimization and error prevention
- **[Claude Execution Guidelines](../core-reference/claude-execution-guidelines.md)** - Proper execution patterns and error recovery

Use this section to maintain high customer success rates through systematic issue resolution and continuous improvement of documentation and processes.
